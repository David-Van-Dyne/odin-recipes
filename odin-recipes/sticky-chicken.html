    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="width: 50%;">Breaded sticky chicken is a mouthwatering dish that combines crispy, golden-brown chicken with a sweet and savory glaze that clings to every bite. The chicken pieces are first coated in a seasoned breading—often made with flour, cornstarch, and spices—then fried or baked until perfectly crunchy. Once cooked, they’re tossed in a rich, glossy sauce made from ingredients like honey, soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic, creating that irresistible sticky coating that balances sweetness with a hint of tang. The result is a dish that’s both crispy and saucy, offering a satisfying texture and bold flavor in every bite.</p>
    <p style="width: 50%;">Perfect for weeknight dinners or entertaining guests, breaded sticky chicken pairs beautifully with steamed rice, noodles, or fresh vegetables. Its restaurant-quality flavor and simple preparation make it a favorite for home cooks looking to impress. The sticky glaze caramelizes slightly as it cools, locking in the flavor and giving the chicken a shiny, appetizing finish. Whether served as a main dish or appetizer, this recipe delivers the perfect combination of crunch, sweetness, and umami that keeps everyone coming back for more.</p>
